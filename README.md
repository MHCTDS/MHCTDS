## Hi there 👋

I am Matheus Henrique Cajueiro Tobias de Souza, currently working as a ML engineer and AI researcher in the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro as a undergraduate computer science student.
My main work is on violence detection and classification on the VISAGE project, a open source violence classification model for social media posts written in brazilian portuguese.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a social media app based on a social sensing architecture, using humans as sensors to discover features of the enviroment around them through NLP analysis of posts and embedded sensors on mobile devices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Vision and ML recommendation systems like the twin tower architecture.
- 📫 How to reach me: 1MHCTDS8@gmail.com

I use github mainly to publish my research code and models in a open source manner, make education content on ML techniques and store a few projects i developed as a way to fixate what i study/project based learning.
