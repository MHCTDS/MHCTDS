## Hi there 👋

I am Matheus Henrique Cajueiro Tobias de Souza, currently working as a ML engineer and AI researcher in the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro as a undergraduate computer science student.<br/>
My main work is on violence detection and classification on the VISAGE project, a open source violence classification model for social media posts written in brazilian portuguese.<br/>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a social media app based on a social sensing architecture, using humans as sensors to discover features of the enviroment around them through NLP analysis of posts and embedded sensors on mobile devices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Vision and ML recommendation systems like the twin tower architecture.

<hr>

I use github to publish my research code and models in a open source manner, make educational content on ML techniques and store a few projects I developed as a way to fixate what I study/project based learning.
